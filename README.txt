1. To build the timer use build/build.cmd (all dependencies are in the trunk)
2. The binaries can then be found in build/output/Debug (to use RELEASE goto build/settings.yml and edit them accordingly to your needs)
3. Start PomodoroTimer, wind it up and go work for at least until your pomodoro ends.
